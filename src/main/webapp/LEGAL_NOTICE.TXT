<p><b>5. Submission of Contributions</b>.
Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

<p>
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
</p>
1. DEFINITIONS
<p>
"Contribution" means:
</p><p>
a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and<br>
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
</p><p>
i) changes to the Program, and
</p><p>
ii) additions to the Program;
</p><p>
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from <a name="usageLevelLicense">and are distributed by that particular Contributor</a>. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. <a name="joinLevelLicense">Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.</a>
</p><p>
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
</p><p>
"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.
</p><p>
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
</p><p>
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.
</p><p>
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
</p><p>
<a name="returnAddedCodeRestrictionLicense">a)</a> Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, <a name="feeForSoftwareRestrictionLicense">royalty-free copyright license</a> <a name="copyRestrictionLicense">to reproduce</a>, <a name="modificationRestrictionLicense">prepare derivative works of</a>, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
</p><p>
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, <a name="expressPatentLicenseRestrictionLicense">each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.</a>
</p><p>
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.

i) <a name="disclaimerRestrictionLicense">effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;</a>
</p><p>
ii) <a name="excludeDamagesRestrictionLicense">effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;</a>
</p><p>
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
</p><p>
<a name="openSourceAddedCodeRestrictionLicense">iv)</a> <a name="openSourceOriginalCodeRestrictionLicense">states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.</a>
</p><p>
When the Program is made available in source code form:
</p><p>
<a name="includeAddedCodeRestrictionLicense">a) it must be made available under this Agreement;</a> and
</p><p>
b) <a name="includeLicenseRestrictionLicense">a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.</a>
</p><p>
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.
</p><p>
<a name="sourceNoticesRestrictionLicense">Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.</a>
</p><p>
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
</p><p>
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, <a name="indemnificationRestrictionLicense">if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.</a> The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
</p><p>
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
</p><p>
5. NO WARRANTY
</p><p>
<a name="distributorDisclaimerRestrictionLicense">EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.</a>
</p><p>
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
</p><p>
<a name="distributorExcludeDamagesRestrictionLicense">EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</a>
</p><p>
7. GENERAL
</p><p>
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
</p><p>
<a name="patentRetaliationRestrictionLicense">If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</a>
</p><p>
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
</p><p>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
</p><p>
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

</ul>
</ul><b>3. Distribution Obligations.</b>
<ul>
<b>3.1. Application of License.</b>
<a name="includeAddedCodeRestrictionLicense">The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of
this License, including without limitation Section <b>2.2</b>.</a> The Source Code version of
Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of
this License released under Section <b>6.1</b>, and You must include a copy of this License
with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on
any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or
the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering
the additional rights described in Section <b>3.5</b>. <br><br>
<b>3.2. Availability of Source Code.</b>
<a name="openSourceAddedCodeRestrictionLicense">Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in
Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable
version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became
available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular
Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring
that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism
is maintained by a third party.</a> <br><br>
<b>3.3. Description of Modifications.</b>
<a name="sourceNoticesRestrictionLicense">You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the
changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a
prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in
(a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation
in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.</a> <br><br>
<b>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</b>
<ul>
<a name="IPWarrantRestrictionLicense"><b>(a) Third Party Claims</b>.
If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property
rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or
2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled
&quot;LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail
that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the
Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly
modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take
other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably
calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been
obtained. </a><br><br>
<b>(b) Contributor APIs</b>.
If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor
has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API,
Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.
&nbsp;
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Representations.</b>
<ul>
Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above,
Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s)
and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.<br>
<br><br>
</ul>
<b>3.5. Required Notices.</b>
You must duplicate the notice in <b>Exhibit A</b> in each file of the Source Code.&nbsp; If
it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure,
then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user
would be likely to look for such a notice.&nbsp; If You created one or more Modification(s)
You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in <b>Exhibit A</b>.&nbsp;
You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You
describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.&nbsp; You may
choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your
own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it
absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
offered by You alone, and <a name="indemnificationRestrictionLicense">You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.</a> <br><br>
<b>3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</b>
<a name="openSourceOriginalCodeRestrictionLicense">You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section
<b>3.1-3.5</b> have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that
the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section
<b>3.2</b>.</a> The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable
version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights
relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or
ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this
License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the
license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights
in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the
Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any
terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer
or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
result of any such terms You offer. <br><br>
<b>3.7. Larger Works.</b>
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the
terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case,
You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
</ul><b>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</b>
<ul>
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to
some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must:
(a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe
the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL
file described in Section <b>3.4</b> and must be included with all distributions of the
Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must
be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
</ul><b>5. Application of this License.</b>
<ul>
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in
<b>Exhibit A</b> and to related Covered Code.
</ul><b>6. Versions of the License.</b>
<ul>
<b>6.1. New Versions</b>.
Netscape Communications Corporation (''Netscape'') may publish revised and/or new versions
of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version
number. <br><br>
<b>6.2. Effect of New Versions</b>.
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may
always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such
Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape.
No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code
created under this License. <br><br>
<b>6.3. Derivative Works</b>.
If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to
apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a)
rename Your license so that the phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'',
&quot;MPL&quot;, ''NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license
(except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear
that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License
and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or
Contributor in the notice described in <b>Exhibit A</b> shall not of themselves be deemed to
be modifications of this License.)

<b>8.1.&nbsp; </b>This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted
shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must
remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. <br><br>
<b>8.2.&nbsp; </b><a name="patentRetaliationRestrictionLicense">If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
(excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the
Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as

<b>(a)&nbsp; </b>such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any
patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or

pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of
Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect

You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the
date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
Participant. <br><br>
<b>8.3.&nbsp; </b>If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent
where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of
patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such
Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount
or value of any payment or license.</a> <br><br>
<b>8.4.</b>&nbsp; In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,&nbsp; all end
user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly
granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

<ul>
The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct.
1995), consisting of ''commercial computer software'' and ''commercial computer software
documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government

applicable version of this License or the recipients
rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a
fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and <a name="indemnificationRestrictionLicense">You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred

4.2. Effect of New Versions.
        <p>
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise
make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
version of the License under which You originally received
the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a
notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being
distributed or otherwise made available under any
subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
version of the License under which You originally received
the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to
use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software
available under the terms of any subsequent version of the
License published by the license steward.

4.3. Modified Versions.
        <p>

the license and remove any references to the name of the
license steward (except to note that the license differs
from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that
the license contains terms which differ from this License.

<li> LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</li>
<p>
<a name="distributorExcludeDamagesRestrictionLicense">UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF

INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
APPLY TO YOU.</a>
    </p>
<li> U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</li>
<p>
The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is
defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial
computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.
252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software
documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.
This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,
any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses
Government rights in computer software under this License.
    </p>
<li> MISCELLANEOUS.</li>
    <p>
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice
contained within the Original Software (except to the extent
applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation
relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of
the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a
notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing
party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court
costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall
be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the
United States export administration regulations (and the export
control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
    </p>
<li> RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</li>
    <p>
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
of liability.
